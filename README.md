# Automated ELT Pipeline with Airflow, dbt, and PostgreSQL

This project demonstrates how to build a modern data pipeline using **Apache Airflow**, **dbt**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Docker**. The pipeline extracts data from an external API, loads it into a Postgres database, transforms it using dbt, and orchestrates everything through Airflow.
